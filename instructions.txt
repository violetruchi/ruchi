make the changes
i should have done the major work
you'll just have to replace images/ add text in index.html

open sublime text in my laptop
go to the bottom right window, should be a terminal


in the terminal type:
"cd violet"
press ctrl+shift+G
you will see your cursor at : "git commit -m |"
type datetime as mm_hh_dd_mm_yy and only then press enter
type "git push"

should work, if does not:
type "git pull" enter and then "git push"

changes should reflect on website in 10 mins
